# Gesture Recognition using Mediapipe

This project utilizes the Mediapipe library to implement gesture recognition for detecting "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" gestures. By leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision, this project aims to provide an efficient solution for gesture-based interactions.

## Key Features
- Real-time Gesture Detection: Recognizes "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" gestures using hand landmarks.
- Mediapipe Integration: Utilizes Google's Mediapipe framework to track hand movements and gestures.
- Practical Applications: Can be extended to various real-world applications such as sign language recognition, interactive systems, or accessibility tools.

## Project Overview
The gesture recognition system is built using Mediapipe’s hand tracking solution, which provides high-accuracy hand and finger tracking capabilities. This project focuses on detecting specific hand gestures (thumbs up/down) to demonstrate its potential for broader gesture-based control systems.
